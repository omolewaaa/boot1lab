# boot1lab
The lab1 branch contains a function called 'aritGeo' that takes one argument array. it checks if the array passed as an argument is Arithmetic, Geometric or neither Arithmetic nor Geometric. if argument is arithmetic progressions, it returns Arithmetic, if argument is 
geometric progressions, it returns Geometric, if argument is neither Arithmetic nor Geometric it returns -1 and if argument is empty it returns null and the test1 folder contains the test cases for the function aritGeo

The lab2 file contains the function called `fizzBuzz` to return 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz', or the argument it receives, all depending on the argument of the function, a number that is divisible by, 3, 5, or both 3 and 5, respectively.
When the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the number itself should be returned, and the test files contains the test cases 
These programs follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) process and the tool used is Jasmine.
